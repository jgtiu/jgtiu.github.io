I'm Jessica, a current grad student at Duke University and former Machine Learning Researcher and Natural Language Processing Team Lead at [Thinking Machines Data Science](https://thinkingmachin.es/).

Having worked 6 years in the Southeast Asian data science industry, I love growing and learning with teams who create value on the many sides of data work: in analysis, data engineering, and software.
