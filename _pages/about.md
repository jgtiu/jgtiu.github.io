Hi! I'm Jessica, a data scientist at Aetna, working on analytical solutions for healthcare and insurance. I got my Master's in Computer Science at Duke University, and did machine learning and natural language processing at [Thinking Machines Data Science](https://thinkingmachin.es/).

I love growing and learning with teams who create value on the many sides of data work: in analysis, data engineering, and software.
