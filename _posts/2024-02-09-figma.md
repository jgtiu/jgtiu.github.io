Figma's online collaborative whiteboard FigJam came out with new [AI features](https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-ai-to-figjam/){:target="_blank"} last November 2023. The new features take the grunt work out of team meetings by automating these common meeting tasks:

| Meeting Task                           | FigJam feature                   |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Do prep work for syncs and brainstorms | Generate templates using prompts |
| Identify themes and organize ideas     | Auto-sort stickies into groups   |
| Get key takeaways and next steps       | Generate summary                 |

## What is this post for?

We will be exploring how users have been adopting FigJam's (1) Generate template with AI, (2) Sort stickies, and (3) Summarize capabilities.

Why? Whenever a software tool releases new features, the data/product teams behind them often study user behaviors and extract patterns from them to improve the new features or the overall product experience. Here I wear a product data scientist's hat to show how I currently think about measuring the effectiveness of the new AI features.

**A caveat**: While real product teams focus on the *insights* rather than the tools they use to get there, I'll be sprinkling a few snippets of Python/SQL throughout this post to clarify how I arrived at specific conclusions.

## Fake data

I don't work at Figma, so I generated fake and random usage data in lieu of the real thing to show what it might look like (I used the [Faker](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/){:target="_blank"} Python package to do this). Of course, there's always room to make it more realistic!

The three tables below might not look like much, but we can extract quite a few insights from here. Read on:

### Users data preview

|user_id|email|job_title|
|----|----|----|
|1|wilsonmaria@example.org|Student or educator|
|2|jesse56@example.org|Student or educator|
|3|elaine71@example.com|Product management|
|4|davistimothy@example.org|Other|
|5|emily21@example.com|Student or educator|

Figma [collects each user's email and job title](https://www.figma.com/blog/how-we-use-data/){:target="_blank"} when they sign up.

### Sessions data preview

Each time a user opens a new board, a new session is created.

|user_id|session_id|session_date|
|----|----|----|
|1|03a61d4a-0ceb-45c4-9ec6-c3dea753ce4e|2023-08-22|
|1|0c0bba2a-f732-4487-a02f-a93e9d52d0af|2023-07-11|
|1|a0457dee-50f4-431d-a4ea-fcc05275c505|2023-02-21|
|1|099496b0-e2a5-444b-a9f6-ff07711516e7|2023-02-08|
|1|e2c31a5f-434c-4917-89be-a2295ca75b8a|2023-02-21|

### Actions data preview

In generating this table, I test-drove FigJam and came up with these actions that a user can do on FigJam. For simplicity, I focused on the new AI features (generate template / sort stickies / summarize) and less on other actions like adding stickies and widgets.

```python
ACTION_TYPES = {
    0: "open figjam",
    1: "open generate modal",
    2: "open template modal",
    3: "generate template using ai",
    4: "add template from templates menu",
    5: "sort stickies",
    6: "summarize",
    7: "copy link to summary",
    8: "copy summary as text",
    9: "some other action",
    10: "close figjam"
}
```

|session_id|action_seq_num|action_|action_time|
|----|----|----|----|
|03a61d4a-0ceb-45c4-9ec6-c3dea753ce4e|0|Open figjam|13:00:47.937440|
|03a61d4a-0ceb-45c4-9ec6-c3dea753ce4e|1|Some other action|13:04:13.849576|
|03a61d4a-0ceb-45c4-9ec6-c3dea753ce4e|2|Some other action|13:11:42.384788|
|03a61d4a-0ceb-45c4-9ec6-c3dea753ce4e|3|Open template modal|13:15:45.839381|
|03a61d4a-0ceb-45c4-9ec6-c3dea753ce4e|4|Add template from templates menu|13:16:19.476087|

## Insights

Product success is often measured in terms of [activation, engagement, and retention](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1332258235380665633/comprehensive-product-metrics-guide){:target="_blank"}. Given Figma's broader goal of allowing people to collaborate in a visual setting, and FigJam AI's narrower goal of speeding up or eliminating work, not all of these measures of success will make sense. For example, it might make sense to optimize the MAU (monthly active users) metric, because monthly usage could signal FigJam's usefulness. But DAU (daily active users) might not signal the same thing: it might mean users are unable to finish what they wanted to within a short time.

The following insights are just some that can be extracted from the fake data generated above.

### #1 Most users are non-designers

... which is a good thing! This means that users don't need to be fluent in visual software to use Figma.

![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2024-02-09-figma/figma-seaborn-viz-users.png)

How the above result was calculated:

```sql
SELECT
    job_title,
    COUNT(*) AS num_users,
    COUNT(*) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users) * 100 AS perc_of_users
FROM users
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```

### #2 AI-generated templates are getting traction

![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2024-02-09-figma/figma-seaborn-viz-adoption.png)

How the above result was calculated:

```sql
WITH last_creation_mode_used AS (
    SELECT
        sessions.session_id,
        sessions.session_date,
        MAX(actions.action_seq_num) AS action_seq_num
    FROM sessions
    JOIN actions
    USING (session_id)
    WHERE actions.action_
        IN ('generate template using ai', 'add template from templates menu')
        AND sessions.session_date >= '2023-11-07'
    GROUP BY 1, 2
),
sub AS (
    SELECT
        DATE_TRUNC('month', last_creation_mode_used.session_date)
            AS session_month,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN actions.action_ = 'generate template using ai'
            THEN session_id ELSE NULL END)
            AS boards_finalized_using_generate_ai,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN actions.action_ = 'add template from templates menu'
            THEN session_id ELSE NULL END)
            AS boards_finalized_using_premade,
    FROM actions
    JOIN last_creation_mode_used
    USING (session_id, action_seq_num)
    GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT
    *,
    ROUND(boards_finalized_using_generate_ai
        / (boards_finalized_using_generate_ai + boards_finalized_using_premade) * 100)
        AS perc_boards_finalized_using_generate_ai
FROM sub
```

**For follow-up analysis**: Do these lessen the "blank canvas paralysis" that users get when faced with a new FigJam board?

### #3 Non-designers are the earliest adopters of the AI-generated templates

<img src="/assets/2024-02-09-figma/figma-seaborn-viz-grouped-bar.png" width=800>

How the above result was calculated:

```sql
WITH last_creation_mode_used AS (
    SELECT
        users.job_title,
        sessions.session_id,
        MAX(actions.action_seq_num) AS action_seq_num
    FROM sessions
    JOIN actions
    USING (session_id)
    JOIN users
    USING (user_id)
    WHERE actions.action_
        IN ('generate template using ai', 'add template from templates menu')
        AND sessions.session_date >= '2023-11-07'
    GROUP BY 1, 2
),
sub AS (
    SELECT
        last_creation_mode_used.job_title,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN actions.action_ = 'generate template using ai'
            THEN session_id ELSE NULL END) AS boards_finalized_using_ai,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN actions.action_ = 'add template from templates menu'
            THEN session_id ELSE NULL END) AS boards_finalized_using_premade,
    FROM actions
    JOIN last_creation_mode_used
    USING (session_id, action_seq_num)
    GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT
    job_title,
    boards_finalized_using_ai,
    boards_finalized_using_premade,
    boards_finalized_using_ai + boards_finalized_using_premade AS total,
    ROUND(boards_finalized_using_ai / boards_finalized_using_premade, 4)
        AS ai_premade_ratio,
FROM sub
ORDER BY ai_premade_ratio DESC
```

### #4 There is an opportunity to get more users to try AI-generated templates

![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2024-02-09-figma/figma-seaborn-viz-funnel.png)

How the above result was calculated:

```sql
WITH last_creation_mode_used AS (
    SELECT
        sessions.session_id,
        MAX(actions.action_seq_num) AS action_seq_num
    FROM sessions
    JOIN actions
    USING (session_id)
    WHERE actions.action_
        IN ('generate template using ai', 'add template from templates menu')
        AND sessions.session_date >= '2023-11-07'
    GROUP BY 1
),
boards_generated_with_ai AS (
    SELECT session_id
    FROM actions
    JOIN last_creation_mode_used
    USING (session_id, action_seq_num)
    WHERE actions.action_ = 'generate template using ai'
),
users_who_finalized_boards_with_ai AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT user_id
    FROM sessions
    JOIN boards_generated_with_ai
    USING (session_id)
)
SELECT
    users.job_title,
    COUNT(DISTINCT users.user_id) AS num_users,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN actions.action_ = 'open generate modal'
        THEN users.user_id ELSE NULL END) AS aware_generate_ai,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN actions.action_ = 'generate template using ai'
        THEN user_id ELSE NULL END) AS tried_generate_ai,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN user_id
        IN (SELECT user_id FROM users_who_finalized_boards_with_ai) THEN user_id
        ELSE NULL END) AS finalized_with_ai
FROM users
JOIN sessions
USING (user_id)
JOIN actions
USING (session_id)
GROUP BY 1
```

### #5 The summarize feature is effective

![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2024-02-09-figma/figma-seaborn-viz-summarize.png)

How the above result was calculated:

```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(DISTINCT session_id) AS num_sessions,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN action_ = 'summarize' THEN session_id
        ELSE NULL END) AS num_sessions_with_summary,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN action_ LIKE 'copy%summary%' THEN session_id
        ELSE NULL END) AS num_sessions_with_useful_summary,
FROM actions
JOIN sessions
USING (session_id)
WHERE session_date >= '2023-11-07'
```

## Limitations

- While generating data for this study, I did not simulate collaborators working together in a session. I could do this for a more realistic and complex analysis.
- For simplicity, I also did not generate data to reflect that a FigJam board might be revisited in multiple sessions.
- I did this study by myself to show my thought process, but data science should not be done in a vacuum/bubble! If I were to do this analysis as a real data science task, I'd definitely talk to people on the data and product (and even user research!) teams to get their perspectives on what is important to measure. Cross-functional perspective is essential to get to the truth of usage behavior and user satisfaction.
